            <p>From the groundbreaking release of Akira to the philosophical depths of Ghost in the Shell, cyberpunk anime has consistently pushed the boundaries of both animation and storytelling. This genre has not just reflected our technological anxieties‚Äîit's helped shape our vision of the future.</p>

            <h2>The Foundations: Akira and Ghost in the Shell</h2>
            <p>When Akira exploded onto screens in 1988, it set a new standard for animation and cyberpunk storytelling. Its themes of technology, power, and human evolution resonated globally. Ghost in the Shell followed in 1995, delving deeper into questions of consciousness and identity in a digitized world.</p>

            <h2>The New Wave</h2>
            <p>Modern cyberpunk anime has evolved to address contemporary concerns. Series like Psycho-Pass and Serial Experiments Lain explore surveillance, social media, and artificial intelligence with a distinctly Japanese perspective. These works continue to influence creators worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Future Visions</h2>
            <p>As technology rapidly advances, cyberpunk anime remains remarkably prescient. Its explorations of transhumanism, artificial intelligence, and corporate power feel more relevant than ever. The genre continues to evolve, finding new ways to examine the relationship between humanity and technology.</p>
